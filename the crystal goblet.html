		<p class="explain">There are metaphors, about flagons of wine and such things. These metaphors are in relation to design, they explain how designs an print can work in presenting something. There is also plenty of focus to typographic design and the typographer the author has interacted with and their experience designing stuff.</p>
		
		<p class="explain">I found it to be beating around the bush to much, with what it's saying can be condensed into just a couple a paragraphs rather than an entire essay explaining the metaphor and how it relates to design and print, though I understand the reasoning, it is just long.</p>
